<b>What are your new routines?<b/> <br><br>
 
My new routines in school as a Benildean. I will do my best to have a high grades and make my parents proud. <br>
I want to improve my talents and skills. And I will study hard but of course I would enjoy my college life by not doing any <br>
things that are not good I know in college there are many temptations unlike in highschool and in college there are many different <br>
people that you will know. I know that there are many challenges that I will face now that Im in college but I'll do my best <br>
to conquer and face all the challenges in order to graduate and be a successful. <br><br><br>

<b>What are your new Roles?</b><br><br>
My new roles. I think my new roles right now is to be a good student, a good daughter or be a responsible person. <br>  In being a good student, I'm not that type of a intellegent student or what we call it as a "nerd" but I can sure <br> that I do not get a failing grades and in that way I can surely know that I can make my parents happy even if Im not a dean lister they will see that I study and do my best in studying. Being responsible is not that hard to do you'll just need to have a self-discipline in order to do your responsibilities. <br><br><br>

<b>What are your new assumptions?</b><br><br>
I assume that I can be a successful! :) Of course everyone wants it but right now I want this year will be a blast. I wish I will <br> enjoy my first year in college or first year of being a GDD student. I want also to learn new things specially about programing <br> or creating my own games. <br><br><br>

<b>What are your New Relationships?</b> <br><br>
Everyone has a new relationships. New relationship in our new professors, new classmates and new friends. Everything was new <br> in college. In our different professors I thought that it will be hard to have a good relation with them because i  <br> thought in college there are terror professors but now I can see that we built a good relationship with them they help as <br> in adjusting in being a college student. In my new classmates and friends I don't have any hard time to join with them <br> and make fun and of course study with them. We help each other, in our report, in  homeworks or in anything that we can <br> do to help each other.
