FROSH SOLIDARITY NIGHT

Frosh Solidarity Night, I was curious about it I know that it was a welcome party for all of the froshies. At first I was excited knowing that we are having a frosh solidarity night and it was awsome. It started with the mass then they introduce some of the organization that we are encouraging to join. Then some of the higher batch present some play and it was fun. They interpret and present the life of being a benildean, they did it in a fun way and artistic. The play is all about how to survive in being college and they show us the way of living in college life and they show the rules. Then after that the cheering squad show their stunts and they show us some of the cheers. It was fun because I'm with my friends we enjoy together then we take a picture in the photobooth. And I feel sad a little bit because in that day I know that it is the last time that we can be together because I know when the class started we will be busy to our studies. But in the end of the day the "Frosh Solidarity Night" was awsome the venue was good also the way it was organized and specially the foods it was good.
