1. Have you ever failed in an exam? What were the reasons for failing?

answer: 
Yes, I failed in some of my exams because I did not study well. I'll just review some of the topic on the spot before the examination. Somtime the topic that I review are not included in the exam so that I feel lazy in studying the next exam.

2. For those who haven't failed an exam, what were your highest score in the exam? What would you think that made you reach the top?

answer:
I didn't answer this question because I experience failing in an exam.

3. How was your first experience of CSB midterm examination? Knowing what you know now, What would have you done differently? What are you going to do again for the CSB finals?

answer:
At first I feel nervous, because I didn't want to failed again specially now that I'm in college every point or score is important. Now I study hard and avoid being lazy and I always tell to my self "I have to pass", "I have to do this", "I have to study". In finals I guess I do what I did in my CSB midterm.
