FROSH ORIENTATION PROGRAM

When I enrolled in Saint Benilde we are informed that we were having a Frosh Orientation Program, and I don't have any idea that it was for us because I don't know the meaning of "FROSH" ^^ . Then when I go to the FOP, at first, I feel a little bit nervous about the orientation because I know that when I go there I don't have anyone to talk to, I don't know anyone. Then before it's started we are arranged by block and then after that our orientors started to introduce their selves. Then the orientation started and I enjoyed it because we do some of the activities like; playing some games and getting to know each other and I thought I was going to be bored because I know some of the orientation are just talking and talking. After we have our lunch break our orientors tour us around the campus they introduce all the things,rooms and some of the office that we can see around the campus. Then after that they talked about the rules and regulations of the school. They discuss about the theme of the school and specially the proper attire that we have to wear around the campus. They mentioned about our assigned attire, In Monday & Tueday we are assigned to wear a business attire and from wednesday to friday casual attire. I was shocked because I thought that they don't have uniform in Benilde but because of the orientation I learned that it is depend to the course some of the courses have their assigned attire or uniform but for others don't have.
I've learned many things after the orientation and because of the frosh orientation program my nervous in the first day of class is less than usaull. It helps me a lot because I find some friends in the orientation and I've met and get to know with my blockmates.
