<b>STRENGTHS<b/> <br><br><br>
 
* Being Failed in Something <br><br>
* Friends <br><br>
* GOD <br><br>
In in being failed in something I can motivate my self to do all my best to make-up my failures <br> And I get my strength to my friends, I learn something about their comments or advices that they give to me <br> in order to have strength. And also when I failed in a subject I make-up my mind and I intend to study harder. And of course God I always get a strength with him. </b><br><br>

<b>WEAKNESSES</b><br><br>
* Shy <br><br>
* Fighting<br><br>
* Alone <br><br>
These are my weaknesses, being shy sometimes I want to do something but I can't do it because I'm shy. Fighting, I don't wan't to see people fighting each other specially the people that are close to me <br> like my friends and my family. And lastly I don't want to experience 
being alone <br><br><br>

<b>ROLE MODEL</b><br><br>
* My Mother <br><br>
I think I only have one role model and its my mom. Because even though I'm not grown up with her I understand, <br> She sacrifices alot to our family specially to me she did her best to give me a better future until now she continue her work for us. And I know she's to tired <br> but she didn't give up. <br><br><br>

<b>CORE VALUES</b><br><br>
* Friends <br><br>
* Family <br><br>
These two are the most important thing in my life without them I will not survive in the journey of life :)
